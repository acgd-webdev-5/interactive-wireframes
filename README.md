# Pattern library

## Overview

Code the pattern library for your portfolio website. *Consider every unique component of the website.*

Some details & things about the website to consider:

- It should be completely responsive between 320px – ~2500px.
- Include any typefaces you’re planning on using.
- Only placeholder images are necessary, but they should be representative of what will be included (sketches, roughs, finals, etc.)
- Use grid systems, type systems & default module CSS.
- **ABSOLUTELY NO JAVASCRIPT!!**—your site should be fully functional without it, we’ll add it in later.
- Create all the unique components you think you need based on the sketches of your portfolio.

*Nothing is permanent—you can change these patterns as you go.*

### Critiques

We’ll be performing critiques to get a grade for this project. *More details below, in the “Hand-in” section.*

### Get critiques & grade yourself

To receive a grade on the pattern library you’ll need to:

- [ ] **Get 3 peer critiques**
- [ ] **Fill out the rubric**
- [ ] **Write a personal performance rationale**
- [ ] **Get the teacher’s critique**
- [ ] **Determine a grade**

#### 3 peer critiques

Select 3 of your peers and get them to [critique your project ➔](/courses/shared/peer-evaluation/)

Also consider performing [usability tests ➔](topics/usability-testing-checklist/)

#### Fill out the rubric

Using the rubric above, [copy the code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acgd-webdev-5/pattern-library/gh-pages/rubric.md) to a GitHub Issue, attached to your repository, and select the appropriate grade for each section.

Sum the values of the rubric & put that at the bottom of the Issue.

#### Personal performance rationale

As a GitHub Issue, attached to your repository, write a short-ish rationale explaining how well you did completing your project:

- What did you do well?
- What did you do poorly?
- What could be improved?
- What problems did you run into?
- What complications did you overcome?
- Does the website communicate the right message?
- Is the website usable?

#### Teacher critique

Meet with the teacher in class and get a critique of your project.

#### Determine a grade

Using all the above information, assign yourself a grade that reflects everything you’ve completed.

Discuss this grade with the teacher—if it’s fair & honest the teacher will assign the grade immediately.
